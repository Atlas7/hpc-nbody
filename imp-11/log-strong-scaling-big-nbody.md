# Strong and Weak Scaling Studies - on Implementation 11

### Strong Scaling Study - Big n-body case (More Robust)

Given a fixed total problem size of (1,048,576 particles), how does the duration and overall performance vary with the number of processors?

Noes = 1 case

```

```

Nodes = 2 Case

```

```

Nodes = 4 Case

```

```

Noes = 8 case

```

```

Nodes = 16 Case

```

```

Nodes = 32 Case

```

```
